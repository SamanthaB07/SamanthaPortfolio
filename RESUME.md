My name is Samantha Burnham. I go to McIntosh High School.
I am a freshman in High School. This is my first year in Software Technology. I started school in Kedron Elementry School in fifth grade, and then to JC Booth Middle. 
I volunteer and help my mom at Royal Animal Refuge.
When im not in school I enjoy walking around outside.
